# HR-Analytics-Cleaning
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a Human Resources (HR) dataset for further analysis.
Before meaningful insights can be visualized, the dataset must be organized, cleaned, and transformed to ensure accuracy and clarity.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **prepare the dataset for high-quality data visualization** by:

- Removing unnecessary or inconsistent data  
- Renaming and standardizing columns  
- Cleaning key fields  
- Ensuring the dataset contains no duplicates or missing values  
- Applying filters and transformations to highlight relevant subsets (e.g., employees who left)

## Tasks Performed — Data Cleaning Steps

### **1. Removed redundant or irrelevant columns**  
Unnecessary fields were dropped to simplify the dataset and avoid noise in visualizations.

### **2. Renamed and standardized columns**  
Column names were made consistent, readable, and suitable for visualization labeling.

### **3. Checked and handled duplicates**  
Verified that no duplicate records existed that could distort visuals or metrics.

### **4. Cleaned and normalized key columns**, including:
- Filtering employees with **more than 8 years at the company**  
- Selecting rows where **Attrition = "Yes"**  
- Replacing underscores (`_`) with spaces in the `business_travel` column  
- Ensured uniform formatting and categorical consistency

### **5. Checked for missing values (NaN)**  
Confirmed no missing values were present across the dataset.

### **6. Applied additional transformations**  
Performed any extra preprocessing needed to make the dataset ready for clean and accurate visualizations.

## Effective visualizations require:

- Clean, structured data  
- Clear and consistent labels  
- Well-defined categories  
- No duplicates or missing values  
- Properly filtered subsets  

All of these preprocessing steps ensure that the resulting charts, plots, or dashboards will be accurate, easy to interpret, and visually meaningful.
